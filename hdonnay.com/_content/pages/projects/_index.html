This is a page about my projects that I'm sharing with the internet at large.

There should be bitbucket mirrors for all these projects, in addition to the github pages linked to on the project pages.

####A word on licenses:

I'm not a huge fan of the GNU General Public License, and try to avoid it when working on my own code.

The main reason I dislike it is that it infects any project that wants to copy it. I feel this is kind of against the spirit of Free Software. For the software I write and release that I feel needs a license, I use a modified X11/MIT license that disallows commercial use.
