This is a page about my projects that I'm sharing with the internet at large.

####A word on licenses:

I'm not a huge fan of the GNU General Public License, and try to avoid it when working on my own code.

The main reason I dislike it is that it infects any project that wants to copy it. I feel this is kind of against the spirit of Free Software. For the software I write and release that I feel needs a license, I use a modified X11/MIT license that disallows commercial use.
