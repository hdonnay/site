Welcome to your new website powered by [PieCrust]!

As you can see there's a couple of nice pages already created for you, along with a simple
blog with a few posts. If you intend to write a lot of blog posts with tags and categories,
please look into [baking your site][1] for better performance.

## More stuff

There's a few other things set up for you:

* Some templates for adding [Blueprint][2] or [Less][3] to your pages. This very page is
  actually rendered with them.
* Some macros to add a [Disqus][4] thread or some [Google analytics][5] to your pages. One
  macro we're using here is the one to import a [Google WebFont][6].


## What now?

Now you just need to add the really tasty bits!

* Edit the `_content/config.yml` file and change what obviously needs to be.
* Add new pages in `_content/pages`, edit or remove the `about` page.
* Get rid of the sample posts in `_content/posts` and add your own.
* Drop in your own CSS.
* Change some of the template files in `_content/templates/` (_e.g._ `default`, `blog`, `post`
  and `partial_post`).
* Make yourself at home!
